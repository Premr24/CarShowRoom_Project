Summary:
Developed a console-based Java application to manage key entities of a vehicle showroom, including Showrooms, Employees, and Cars. The system implements basic CRUD-like functionality using object-oriented principles and interface abstraction.

Key Features:
Modular Design: Implemented using separate classes for ShowRoom, Employee, and Cars, all following a common interface utility.

Interactive Menu: Console-based interface allows users to add and view data via a numbered menu system.

Data Handling: Arrays are used to store multiple entries of showrooms, employees, and cars with indexing counters.

User Input: Utilized Scanner class for runtime input collection and information retrieval.

OOP Concepts: Demonstrated practical application of interfaces, encapsulation, and object instantiation in Java.

Technologies Used:
Language: Java

Core Concepts: OOP (Interface, Class), Control Structures, Arrays, Input Handling

Learning Outcomes:
Gained hands-on experience with object-oriented programming in Java.

Understood real-world modeling of business systems like showrooms and employee management.

Enhanced logical structuring and user interaction handling in console applications.
